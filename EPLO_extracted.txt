  This paper proposes an enhanced metaheuristic algorithm named Parallel Polarized Learning 
Optimizer  (EPLO), building upon  the  foundational  Aurora  Optimization Algorithm  (PLO).  The 
original  PLO,  inspired  by  the  motion  of  charged  particles  in  Earth's  magnetic  field,  effectively 
balances global exploration and local exploitation through spiral motion, auroral oval movement, 
and  collision  strategies.  However,  it  suffers  from  limitations  such  as  uneven  initialization, 
premature convergence, and insufficient population diversity due to its single-group structure and 
fixed parameter  decay.  To  address  these  issues,  EPLO  incorporates  several  key  innovations: 1) 
Sobol sequence initialization for uniform search space coverage; 2) A multi-group collaborative 
framework with periodic elite migration to maintain diversity and information exchange; 3) An 
elite pool archive coupled with stagnation-triggered Gaussian revival mechanisms to escape local 
optima;  4)  Adaptive,  non-linear  parameter  control  using  sigmoid/tanh  functions  for  dynamic 
balancing of exploration and exploitation; 5) Late-stage exploitative enhancements including L√©vy-
flight perturbation, numerical gradient refinement, and Gaussian noise injection. The performance 
of EPLO is rigorously evaluated on the IEEE CEC2022 benchmark suites, demonstrating superior 
convergence  speed,  robustness,  and global  search  capability  compared  to  the original  PLO  and 
other state-of-the-art algorithms like BKA, WOA, SCA, FOX, ALO, BA, GSA, HHO, and MFO. 
Furthermore,  EPLO's  practical  efficacy  is  validated  through  five  complex  engineering  design 
problems:  tension/compression  spring  design,  speed  reducer  optimization,  planetary  gear  train 
design, multi-disk clutch brake design, and robotic gripper mechanism optimization. The algorithm 
consistently  achieves  high-quality  solutions  with  remarkable  stability  and  computational 
efficiency.  The  study  also  explores  EPLO's  application  in  challenging  real-world  scenarios, 
including 3D UAV dynamic obstacle avoidance and path planning, as well as 3D wireless sensor 
network  node  localization  (EPLO-DV-Hop),  showcasing  its  adaptability  and  robustness  under 
complex, constrained environments. The results indicate that EPLO is a highly competitive and 
versatile optimizer for both theoretical benchmarks and practical engineering applications. 

1. Introduction 

1.1 Research background and significance 

Optimization  problems  are  common  in  various  engineering  and 
scientific  fields.  Their  goal  is  to  improve  system  performance  or  reduce 
costs by  finding  the best  combination of decision variables.  In  structural 
design, process flow, resource scheduling and other problems, optimization 
can significantly reduce production costs, improve product quality and save 
energy.  Optimization  problems  help  solve  route  planning,  scheduling 
problems  and  inventory  management,  thereby  improving  transportation 
efficiency  and  reducing  logistics  costs[1].  In  asset  allocation,  risk 
management and portfolio optimization, optimization methods can find the 
best  decision  solution  under  uncertainty.  Metaheuristic  algorithms  are 
widely used in parameter optimization, feature selection and neural network 
training to help algorithms jump out of local optimality and obtain better 
model performance[2]. Metaheuristic algorithms have the dual capabilities 
of  global  search  and  local  development  because  they  do  not  rely  on  the 
convexity,  continuity  and  differentiability  of  the  problem[3].  They  have 
unique advantages in dealing with high-dimensional, nonlinear, multi-peak 
and complex constraint problems. These characteristics make metaheuristic 
algorithms  an  effective  solution  strategy  when  facing  complex  and 
ambiguous problems in the real world. 

The field of metaheuristic optimization is in a constant state of vibrant 
evolution,  driven  by  the  quest  for  more  powerful  and  robust  algorithms 
capable of tackling increasingly complex real-world problems. This has led 
to a veritable explosion of novel algorithms inspired by an ever-widening 
array  of  natural  phenomena,  physical  laws,  and  human  social  behaviors.

research  community  has  continuously 

introduced 

Swarm  intelligence  remains  a  fertile  ground,  with  algorithms  like 
the Grey  Wolf  Optimizer  (GWO)[7]  simulating  hierarchical  leadership, 
the Whale  Optimization  Algorithm  (WOA)[8]  mimicking  bubble-net 
the Harris  Hawks  Optimization  (HHO)[9]  modelling  
feeding,  and 

cooperative  predation  tactics.  Recent  years  have  seen  the  emergence  of 
even more niche bio-inspired algorithms, including the Colony Predation 
Algorithm 
(HO)[11], 
the Dandelion  Optimizer  (DO)[12]  inspired  by  seed  dispersal,  the Shark 
Search Algorithm (SSA)[13], the Emperor Penguin Optimizer (EPO)[14], 
and the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CS)[15]. 

the Hippopotamus  Optimization 

(CPA)[10], 

Parallel  to  biological  metaphors,  physics  and  science-inspired 
paradigms  have  gained  substantial  momentum.  These  include  the Sine 
Cosine  Algorithm  (SCA)[16],  the Electromagnetic  Field  Optimization 
(EFO)[17],  the Ion  Motion  Optimizer  (IMO)[18],  the Atom  Search 
Optimization  (ASO)[19]  simulating  atomic  dynamics,  the Equilibrium 
Optimizer (EO)[20] inspired by control-volume mass balance models, and 
the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA)[21]. Mathematics continues to 
provide a foundation for algorithms such as the Chaos Game Optimization 
(CGO)[22] and the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA)[23]. 

Furthermore, human-inspired mechanisms are explored in algorithms 
like  the Teaching-Learning-Based  Optimization  (TLBO)[24],  the Hiking 
Optimization  Algorithm  (HOA)[25],  and  the Social  Network  Search 
(SNS)[26].  This  diversification  also  extends  to  plant-inspired  algorithms 
like  the Invasive  Weed  Optimization  (IWO) [27]  and  the Photosynthesis 
Algorithm  (PA)[28],  challenging  the  traditional  animal-centric  focus  of 
swarm intelligence. 

A significant parallel research thrust focuses not on novel metaphors 
but on enhancing existing algorithms through sophisticated strategies like 
hybridization,  multi-method  fusion,  and  adaptive  parameter  control. 
Techniques  such  as  the GWO-CSA hybrid[29],  the  quantum-based Q-
SCA[30],  and  the Parallel  Compact  Whale  Optimization  Algorithm 
(PCWOA)[31] for WSN localization exemplify this trend towards creating 
more robust and specialized solvers for domains like energy systems and 
engineering design. 

In our own tests, we‚Äôve seen these methods shine on high-dimensional, 
multimodal puzzles: once the search space balloons beyond a handful of 
variables, they outperform textbook optimizers by a wide margin. Yet not 
all  metaheuristics  are  created  equal‚Äîthat‚Äôs  why  innovations  such  as  the 
Aurora Optimization Algorithm (PLO) have drawn attention, thanks to their 
unique physics-inspired motion rules.

In the first part of this work, we review the theoretical underpinnings 
of  charged-particle  dynamics  and  auroral  motions,  identify  the  key 
deficiencies of random seeding and monolithic population updates in PLO, 
and motivate the adoption of low-discrepancy and collaborative strategies 
for enhanced search efficacy. The second part formalizes the mathematical 
modeling  of  PLO‚Äôs  spiral  and  elliptical  motion  operators,  collision 
perturbations,  and  linear  parameter  schedules  to  establish  a  baseline  for 
comparison.  Building  upon  this  foundation,  the  third  part  introduces

governed  by  smooth,  nonlinear  decay  of  reverse-learning  probability,

rigorous  IEEE  CEC2022  benchmark  suite,  conduct  detailed  visual  and 
statistical analyses of convergence trajectories, and demonstrate its superior 
balance of exploration and exploitation relative to both the original PLO 
and  contemporary  metaheuristics.  The  fifth  part  translates  these  findings 
into practical gains by applying EPLO to a range of real-world engineering 
design problems‚Äîspanning spring optimization, reducer design, planetary 
gear  trains,  multi-disk  clutch  brakes,  and  robotic  grippers‚Äîthereby 
validating  its  adaptability  and  robustness  under  complex,  constrained 
scenarios. Finally, the sixth part distills the principal discoveries, contrasts 
EPLO‚Äôs  performance  profile  against  prevailing  algorithms,  and  outlines 
promising  avenues  for  future  research,  including  integration  with 
deep-learning  surrogates  and  deployment 
large-scale,  real-time 
optimization environments. The seventh part applies EPLO to the 3D path 
planning problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles in dynamic obstacle 
environments.    A  multi-module  framework  integrating  threat  modeling, 
graph  construction,  trajectory  optimization  and  takeoff  scheduling  is 
proposed.  EPLO is used to optimize path length, smoothness and safety, 
and  to  avoid  drone  conflicts  through  delayed  scheduling.    Experiments 
show that EPLO outperforms methods such as A*[33], RRT[34] and PSO[4] 
in terms of success rate, path length and the number of conflicts.  The eighth 
part addresses the problem of large positioning error of DV-Hop[35] in 3D 
WSN[36]  and  proposes  the  PPO-DV-HOP  algorithm. 
  The  node 
coordinates are optimized through the weighted normalized fitness function 
and the boundary penalty term.  In complex terrains (single-peak and multi-
peak), PPO-DV-HOP significantly reduces the mean location error (ALE), 
and its stability is superior to that of improved algorithms such as PSO and 
GWO[7].

1.2 Theoretical Basis and Implementation Mechanism of PLO 

The  inspiration  for  PLO  comes  from  the  aurora  phenomenon.  The 
formation of the aurora is due to the luminous phenomenon produced when 
charged particles in the solar wind enter the Earth's magnetic field, move 
along  the  magnetic  field  lines  and  collide  with  gas  molecules  in  the 
atmosphere.  PLO  calculates  the  results  through  simulation.  The  main 
information is as follows: 
1.2.1 Simulation of Charged Particle Motion   

Electron  particles  exhibit  spiral  motion  under  the  Earth's  magnetic 
field, which enables a detailed search of the solution space locally (local

development). Meanwhile, the extensive search for particles in the "aurora 
Ellipse" region has led to in-depth research on aurora formation. 
1.2.2 Multi-Stage Search Strategy   

(1)  Local  Search  (Spiral  Motion):  The  rotational  movement  of 
particles allows the algorithm to accurately seek optimal solutions within 
the current region.   

(2) Global Search (Auroral Ellipse Movement): The unique movement 
pattern of particles within auroral regions enables them to traverse larger 
spaces in pursuit of globally optimal solution areas.   

(3)  Collision  Strategy:  In  the  case  of  motion  simulation  particle 
collisions, the optimal local area is eliminated through random interference, 
which improves the robustness of the algorithm. 

This heuristic design based on physical phenomena provides PLO with 
an intuitive framework for searching that is theoretically grounded, aiming 
to  effectively  balance  capabilities  between  global  exploration  and  local 
exploitation[37]. 
1.3  Mathematical  model  and  pseudocode  of  the  original  Aurora 
optimization algorithm (PLO) 
1.3.1 Mathematical model: 
(1) Initialization   

Suppose that the dimension of the problem space is D and the size of 
the population is N. the initial population is generated with the following 
formula: 

(1) 

In this case, LB and UB represent the lower bound and upper bound 

of the variable respectively. 

Rùëñùëó  represents  random  numbers  uniformly  distributed  within  the 
interval  [0,1],  where  N denotes  the population  size  and  D  represents the 
dimensionality of the problem. 
(2) Gyration motion 

The PLO employs the principles of physics to characterize the motion 
of charged particles within a magnetic field. For instance, the differential 
equation  that  integrates  the  Lorentz  force  with  Newton's  second  law 
elucidates how a particle's velocity varies over time: 

In  this  context, ùëû represents  the  charge  of  the  charged  particles, ùêµ 
denotes the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, and ùõº is a damping factor 
that accounts for atmospheric resistance.  

 (2) 

(3) 

(3) 

(4) 

The strategy is primarily employed for local development: it involves 
a meticulous search within the neighborhood of the current solution over a 
limited scope. 
(3) Aurora oval walk 

In the global exploration phase, auroral elliptical motion simulates the 
phenomenon  that  occurs  when  charged  particles  gather  to  form  auroral 
ellipses due to energy losses and magnetic disturbances after entering the 
earth's  atmosphere.  This  motion process  has  a large  step property  and is 
suitable  for  an  overall  research that helps  particles jump out of the local 
optimum using levy flight to simulate stochastic stride movements: 

(6)

(7) 

(4)Particle collision 

To  avoid  premature  convergence  towards  local  optima,  the  particle 
incorporates  a  collision  based 
swarming  optimization  algorithm 
disturbance  mechanism.  When  a  probability  threshold  is  reached,  the 
current particle collides with neighbouring particles chosen at random. The 
updating rule is worded as follows: 

(8) 

In  this  scenario,  X(a,j)  denotes  the  position  vector  of  a  randomly 
selected neighboring particle, while r 3 represents a uniformly distributed 
random  number  in  [0,1].  The  collision  probability  K  is  dynamically 
determined  by  the  function  K(t)  =  f(t,  T),  where  t  denotes  the  current 
iteration count and T represents the predefined maximum iteration limit. 
1.4 Limitations of the original PLO algorithm 

The original Particle-Laden Optimization (PLO) algorithm achieves a 
balance  between  global  and  local  search  by  simulating  the  motion  of 
charged particles in the Earth's magnetic field under solar wind conditions. 
Its primary search strategies include spiral movement (local exploitation), 
auroral  elliptical  movement  (global  exploration),  and  particle  collision 
strategies  (escaping  local  optima)[38].  However,  there  are  several 
shortcomings in its practical application:   
(1) 

The  random  generation  of  an  initial  population  often  results  in 
uneven  spatial  distribution  among 
individuals.  Conventional 
uniform  random  initialization  methods  may  lead  to  scattered 
distribution  patterns  of  initial  solutions;  this  scattered  distribution 
often  fails  to  adequately  explore  the  entire  search  space,  thereby 
undermining the algorithm's global exploration capability. 
The original algorithm does not employ a clustering mechanism; all 
individuals  share  the  same  search  strategy  with  insufficient 
information exchange. This singular population update strategy can 
easily cause searches to become trapped in local optima, leading to 
inadequate diversity and severe premature convergence issues.   
The  use  of  linearly  decaying  inertia  weights  and  a  fixed-speed 
update formula is difficult to adapt to the needs of different stages of 
the search process. The balance between global exploration and local 
development 
to  achieve.  The  parameter  update 
mechanism is monotonic and lacks adaptive adjustments at different 
stages of the search. 
Since  this  study  did  not  particularly  focus  on  the  diversity  and 
stagnation of the population, there were no effective or optimal exit 
strategies, no sustainable responses to protect them, and no effective 
mechanisms to prevent decline. 

is  difficult

2.EPLO improvement method and mathematical model 
2.1 Mathematical model of the PLO 
2.1.1 Initialization Phase 

At the very start, the algorithm initializes both the global swarm and 
its  partitioned  sub-swarms.  Positions  are  set  by  Equation  (9)  uniformly 
between the lower bound lb and upper bound ub, and velocities by Equation 
 to zero, ensuring pure random exploration initially. 

 (4) 

(9) 

During the  movement  of charged particles,  random  shocks between 
the  particles  can  cause  mutations  in  the  trajectories  of  motion.  This 
phenomenon is used in optimization to improve the ability of algorithms to 
get out of the local optimum and, finally, update individual positions by a 
weighted combination of local and global search: 

(5) 

The  stochastic  perturbation  coefficient  r2  is  confined  within  the 
interval  [0,  1].  Weight  factors W1 and W2 are  employed  to  dynamically 
modulate  the  trade-off  between  local  search  and  global  exploration. 
Typically,  these  weights  are  adjusted  via  nonlinear  decay  functions  to 
achieve adaptive parameter tuning, 

2.1.2 Adaptive Parameter Control 
At each iteration t, the inertia weight w and acceleration coefficients c1, c2 

adapt  based  on  progress  ratio 

 via  Equations  (10)‚Ä?12),  smoothly 

shifting  from  exploration

to  exploitation.  The  opposition-learning 
ecreases  with  œÑ  per  Equation  (13),  encouraging  more 

opposite-point trials early on.

2.1.3 Velocity & Position Update 

Each  particle‚Äôs  velocity  and  position  update  via  the  standard  PSO 
Equations (14)‚Ä?15), combining inertia, cognitive, and social components, 
then clamping positions within the bounds. 

Then, particles‚Ä?velocities and positions are updated according to the 

improved PLO formulas, with boundary constraints enforced:

(15) 

2.1.4 Opposition-based Learning 

Also,  an  opposition  learning  probability  is  introduced  to  increase 
,  an  opposite  point  is 

population  diversity.  If  a  draw  is  below 

computed  by  Equation  (16-17)  and  accepted  if  it  yields  better  fitness, 
boosting global exploration.: 

(16) 

(17) 

2.1.5 Multi-Level Optimality Coordination Mechanism 
Each particle updates its personal best per Equation (18), and each sub-
swarm retains the best among its particles as gBest per Equation (19). 

   (18) 

(19) 

To enable inter-group information flow, the algorithm adopts a parallel 
migration mechanism. Every mmm iterations (e.g., 10 or 20), each group‚Äôs 
is copied to the next group, replacing the worst particle, according 

to: 

(20) 

Fig. 1.Parallel Migration 
Simultaneously, a global elite pool of size E is maintained, storing the 
top-performing  solutions  across  all  groups.  If  a  sub-swarm‚Äôs  gBest 
outperforms  the  worst  solution  in  the  elite  pool,  it  replaces  it.  This 
mechanism ensures that top solutions are preserved and leveraged as global 
guidance.  The  best  individual  in  the  elite  pool  is  selected  as  the  overall 
globalBest at each iteration. 

2.1.6 Exploitative Enhancements in Later Iterations 

After  sufficient  global  exploration,  the  algorithm  integrates  three 
exploitation-focused mechanisms in the later stage (t > 0.4T): L√©vy-flight 
perturbation,  gradient-based  fine-tuning,  and  Gaussian  noise  injection. 
L√©vy-flight  enables  long  jumps  to  escape  local  optima;  gradient-based 

   (21) 

updates  refine  promising  solutions;  and  Gaussian  noise  ensures  global 
diversity  and  prevents  premature  convergence.  Together,  these  enhance 
robustness and exploitation capabilities in the final search phase. 

A  Levy-flight  perturbation  is  applied  to  the  global  best  for  random 
introduce  L√©vy-flight 

iterations, 

long-range  jumps.  After  40%  of 
perturbation for  

multi-strategy tuning: 

(22) 

(23) 

(24) 
For enhanced late-stage exploration (t>0.4T), a L√©vy flight (Equation 

(24))  perturbs  the  global  best,  where  Œ≤  is  the  L√©vy  parameter  and 
elementwise multiplication. 
After 60% of iterations, apply numerical gradient descent for fine-tuning: 

 (25) 

Every  50  iterations,  Gaussian  noise  N(0,œÉ2)  with  œÉ=0.01(ub‚àílb)  is 

added to globalBest to maintain exploration. 
2.2 EPLO analysis 

The EPLO algorithm inherits and extends the classical Particle Learning 
Optimization  (PLO)  framework  by  integrating  parallel  subpopulations, 
inter-subpopulation migration, an elite pool mechanism, and multi-strategy 
refinement to enhance search efficiency and solution quality. The original 
PLO algorithm employs dynamically adjusted inertia weights and learning 
factors, guiding particles‚Ä?velocity and position updates based on individual 
best (pBest) and global best (gBest) positions, enabling global optimization 
in continuous spaces. Building on this, EPLO divides the population into 
multiple  subgroups,  where  particles  update  in  parallel  guided  by  local 
subgroup bests (gBest), accelerating convergence. It periodically migrates 
the  best  solution  from  one  subgroup  to  replace  the  worst  particle  in  a 
neighboring  subgroup,  facilitating  information  sharing  and  diversity 
learning  dynamically 
maintenance.  Additionally,  opposition-based 
generates  opposite candidate  solutions  to improve exploration[39],  while 
late-stage multi-strategy refinements including Levy flights[40] and finite-
difference  gradient  estimation[41]  finely  tune  the  global  best  solution, 
significantly improving local exploitation. 

From  a  time complexity  perspective,  let  the  problem dimension be  D, 
total population size N, maximum iterations T, and cost of a single fitness 
Evaluation  COF.  PLO‚Äôs  per-iteration  computation  primarily  involves 
particle velocity and position updates at O(N‚ãÖD) and fitness evaluations at 
O(N‚ãÖCOF),  resulting  in  an  overall  complexity  of  O(T‚ãÖN‚ã?D+COF)). 
EPLO‚Äôs parallel subpopulations and migration introduce limited additional 
fitness  evaluations,  with  late-stage  refinements  adding  approximately 
D‚ãÖCOF fitness computations. The combined time complexity is expressed 
as O(T‚ã?N‚ã?D+COF)+D‚ãÖCOF)), which approximates to O(T‚ãÖN‚ãÖCOF) when 
population size dominates dimension. Space complexity is dominated by 
storage  of  particle  positions  and  velocities  at  O(N‚ãÖD),  plus  elite  pool, 
subgroup information, and convergence curve data, totaling O(N‚ãÖD+T). 

Compared  to  traditional  PLO,  EPLO‚Äôs  parallel  subpopulations  and 
migration  mechanisms  enhance  population  diversity  and  inter-group 
information  exchange  at  a  macro  level,  improving  global  search  and 
convergence  stability.  At the  micro  level, opposition  learning  and  finite-
difference  gradient  refinement  improve  local  search  capabilities  of 
individual  solutions,  enabling  superior  performance 
in  complex, 
multimodal,  and  moderately  high-dimensional  problems.  Unlike  swarm 
intelligence algorithms such as PSO and GWO, which focus on collective 
group behavior, EPLO combines individual historical bests with multi-level 
group cooperation, reflecting a hybrid macro-micro design philosophy. The 
is  well  suited  for  medium-dimensional  problems  with 
algorithm 
parallelizable fitness evaluations, balancing exploration and exploitation to 
boost search efficiency and solution quality. However, its finite-difference 
refinement may impose computational overhead in very high-dimensional 
or costly fitness scenarios. 

In summary, EPLO serves as a parallelized and enhanced successor to 
PLO,  leveraging  parallel  subpopulations,  migration,  opposition  learning,

3. Experimental Design and Results Analysis 

To  verify  the  effectiveness  of  EPLO,  this  paper  designs  two  types  of 
function  experiments  and  application 

test 

experiments:  standard 
experiments. 
3.1 Standard test function experiment 
3.1.1 Experimental Setup 

The  IEEE  CEC2022  calibration  suite  includes  30  standard  calibration 
functions  selected  for  this  study.  This  reference  set  contains  a  series  of 
complex optimization problems with high dimensions, multimodality, non-
convexity,  non-differentiability,  dynamic  constraints  and  other  difficult 
characteristics. Together, these features allow a complete evaluation of the 
optimization capabilities of the algorithm. Performance indicators used in 
the experiments include optimal solution value, average convergence speed 
and robustness. 
3.1.2 Parameter settings 

To ensure the fairness of the experiment, this study compares the original 
Particle Learning Optimizer (PLO), the improved Proposed PLO(EPLO), 
and other benchmark algorithms within a consistent search environment. 
3.1.3 Problem Dimensions and Experimental Environment 
The experiments were tested on different dimensions (10, 20) in order to 
verify  the  performance  of  the  algorithm  on  low,  medium  and  high 
dimension problems. With MATLAB R2021a (or similar) as the primary 
development  platform,  the  experiment  runs  on  a  desktop  computer 
equipped with an Intel i7 processor and 16 gb ram. Each algorithm is run 
30  times  independently  on  each  test  function  in  order  to  reduce  the 
stochastic effect and to count the mean and standard deviation.

Each algorithm independently executes 30 iterations on each function, 
and simultaneously records the optimal adaptability value and convergence 
curve of each execution. Then calculate the average optimal value and its 
standard deviation of each test function. In order to visually compare the 
convergence  speeds  among  different  algorithms,  the  convergence  curves 
were plotted; Furthermore, the performance data of each algorithm in all 
test functions is compiled in the form of a table. A representation graph of 
the convergence curve A was also generated, which visually illustrates the 
convergence speed and stability. 

The  experimental  results  are  shown in  Table 13,  which  confirm  the 
outstanding  optimization  ability  of  EPLO,  especially  when  applied  to 
various test functions. Specifically, when optimizing the functions F1, F2, 
F3, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10, F11, and F12, the average performance of AOO 
ranks first among all algorithms, with a win rate of 91.67%. This indicates 
that  EPLO  has  strong  competitiveness  in  unimodal  functions,  basic 
functions, mixed functions and composite functions. In direct comparisons 
with  the  BKA,  WOA,  FOX,  PLO,  ALO,  BA,  GSA,  HHO  and  MFO 
algorithms, EPLO performed outstandingly in all 12 benchmark functions. 
It  is  worth  noting  that  EPLO  outperforms  FOX,  PLO,  ALO,  BA,  GSA, 
HHO  and MFO  algorithms on 11  out of  the  12 benchmark  functions.  In

ARAB ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS JOURNAL 00 (2014) 000‚Ä?00 

significant lead undoubtedly highlights EPLO's competitiveness among its 
peers. 

The experimental results, as shown in Table 14, have confirmed the 
exceptional optimization capabilities of EPLO, particularly when applied to 
a variety of test functions. Specifically, when optimizing functions F1, F2, 
F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F11, and F12, EPLO‚Äôs average performance ranks first 
among  all  algorithms  with  a  75%  win  rate.  Furthermore,  when  the  best 
value  is  used  as  the  ranking  criterion,  EPLO  consistently  achieves  top 
rankings,  demonstrating  its  robust  performance  across  the  entire  test 
function  suite.  This  indicates  that  EPLO  has  strong  competitiveness  in 
Unimodal Functions, Basic Functions, Hybrid Functions, and Composition 
Functions. In the direct comparison with BKA, WOA, FOX, PLO, ALO, 
BA, GSA, HHO, and MFO algorithms, EPLO outperforms them in most 
benchmark functions. Notably, EPLO surpasses these algorithms in 11 out 
of  the  12  benchmark  functions.  Regarding  the  average  ranking,  EPLO 
secures the first place with a significant margin, which is notably better than 
the  second-ranked  algorithm,  BKA.  This  significant  lead  undoubtedly 
highlights EPLO‚Äôs competitiveness among its peers. 

The  Fig.  22  curves  presented  in  the  analysis  reveal  that  the  EPLO 
algorithm consistently outperforms other metaheuristic approaches  across 
a diverse set of benchmark functions (F3, F5, F7, F9, F10, and F12). Unlike 
algorithms  such  as  BKA  or  WOA,  which  often  exhibit  premature 
convergence to suboptimal solutions or stagnation in later iterations, EPLO 
maintains a steady and rapid decline in objective function values throughout 
the entire 500-iteration process. For instance, in the case of the F3 function, 
EPLO  demonstrates  an  exceptionally  swift  reduction  in  fitness  values 
during the initial phase, followed by a stable trajectory that ensures minimal 
final error. Similarly, in the F5 function, where other algorithms like ALO 
or  BA  struggle  to escape  local  optima,  EPLO  sustains its  momentum by 
dynamically  adjusting  its  search  strategy,  thereby  avoiding  premature 
convergence. This behavior is further reinforced in the F7 and F9 functions, 
where  EPLO‚Äôs  ability  to  balance  exploration  and  exploitation  phases 
becomes critical. While algorithms like GSA or MFO tend to oscillate or 
plateau  after  initial  progress,  EPLO  continues  to  refine  its  solutions  by 
allocating computational resources efficiently between global exploration 
and  local  exploitation.  In  the  F10  and  F12  functions,  which  test  the 
robustness of algorithms under high-dimensional and complex landscapes, 
EPLO‚Äôs convergence curves remain steeper and more consistent compared 
to  challenging 
to  competitors, 
optimization scenarios. Notably, even in the later stages of iteration, EPLO 
continues to exhibit a downward trend in fitness values, suggesting that its 
design inherently supports prolonged search capabilities without sacrificing 
precision. This is attributed to its sophisticated mechanism for maintaining 
population  diversity  and  dynamically  adjusting  parameters  to  avoid 
premature convergence. In contrast, algorithms such as BA or GSA often 
exhibit  diminishing  returns  in  later  iterations,  as  their  search  strategies 
become overly focused on local regions. The overall performance of EPLO 
across  these  functions  underscores  its  ability  to  achieve  a  harmonious 
interplay  between  exploration  (searching  new  regions)  and  exploitation 
(refining existing solutions), which is essential for navigating multimodal 
and  high-dimensional  problems.  Furthermore,  the  algorithm‚Äôs  consistent 
superiority  in  final  fitness  metrics  across  all  test  cases  highlights  its 
reliability and generalizability, making it a strong candidate for real-world 
optimization tasks where stability and efficiency are paramount. 

its  superior  adaptability 

indicating 

The Fig. 23 presents the convergence curves of the EPLO algorithm 
compared to BKA, WOA, FOX, PLO, ALO, BA, GSA, HHO, and MFO 
on CEC2022 (10-dimensional) test functions F3, F4, F5, F7, F9, and F10. 
Through 500 iterations, EPLO demonstrates significant advantages across 
multiple  benchmarks.  For  instance,  in  F3,  the  EPLO    achieves  a  faster 
convergence  rate  than  BKA,  WOA,  and  FOX,  maintaining  low  fitness 
values  even  in  later  stages,  which  highlights  its  superior  global  search 
capability  and  stability.  In  F4,  although  initial  convergence  speeds  align 
with other algorithms, EPLO dynamically adjusts its strategy to avoid local 
optima, sustaining optimization until the end, while BA and GSA exhibit 
declining  performance  as  their  fitness  values  plateau.  In  the  high-
dimensional  F5  function,  EPLO‚Äôs  convergence  curve  shows  a  consistent 
steep decline, reaching optimal solutions, whereas HHO and MFO suffer 
from premature convergence, leading to suboptimal results. For multimodal 
functions  like  F7  and  F9,  EPLO  balances  exploration  and  exploitation 
effectively, escaping local traps and continuing to reduce fitness values in 
later iterations, unlike PLO and ALO, which stagnate due to rigid strategies. 
In the complex high-dimensional F10 function, EPLO‚Äôs convergence curve 

consistently  outperforms  competitors,  achieving  significantly  lower  final 
errors than BKA and WOA, proving its robustness in challenging scenarios. 
Overall, EPLO ranks first with a 75% average win rate and attains the best 
values in 91.7% of test functions, securing an average ranking over twice 
as  high  as 
the  second-placed  BKA.  This  underscores  EPLO‚Äôs 
comprehensive  strengths  in  convergence  speed,  global  exploration,  and 
stability, offering a reliable and efficient solution for complex optimization 
problems. 
4 Engineering application experiment 
In order to further verify the applicability of EPLO in actual engineering, 
this paper selects the following engineering design problems. 
4.1. Tension/compression spring design issues 
4.1.1 Problem Background and Motivation 
Springs are ubiquitous in mechanical systems and optimizing their design 
is essential to improve performance while minimizing the use of materials. 
The problem of designing a tension/compression spring (TCSD) isa classic 
optimization challenge that involves the choice of design variables to meet 
load  and  frequency  stresses  while  minimizing  the  weight  of  the  spring. 
Traditional methods are based on heuristic formulae or experimental tests. 
However,  nature-inspired  research  methods  have  gained  prominence  in 
recent  years  due  to  their  high  overall  research  capacity  and  their 
effectiveness in solving non-linear and multimodal optimization problems. 

4.1.2 Mathematical Model 

Fig. 2. Tension/compression spring 

The  TCSD  problem  typically  involves  three  decision  variables:  wire 
diameter (d), average coil diameter (D), and the number of active coils (N). 
The objective function is generally to minimize the weight of the spring, 
which can be mathematically expressed as follows: 

Here,  K  represents  a  constant.  It  is  important  to  recognize  that  the 
objective  function  may  vary  slightly  depending  on  different  references. 
Furthermore,  this  problem  also  includes  a  set  of  nonlinear  constraints 
related to constraint limits, natural frequency requirements, and geometric 
limits.

In  the  equation,  the  correction  coefficient  that  links  the  spring  to  a 
specific correction factor, the specific expression of which depends on the 
geometry of the spring and the working conditions. The main challenge of 
the design problem is to determine the combination of the wire diameter (d), 
the average wire diameter (D), and the number of movable wires (N) within 
the feasible design space, minimizing the target function while meeting all 
the imposed constraints.  
4.1.3 Experimental Process and Results 

We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the stress/compression 
spring (TCSD) design issues of several meta-heuristic algorithms. Our goal 
is to reduce the mass of the spring by adjusting three design variables: wire 
diameter d, average  wire  diameter  D,  and the  number  of  active  wires  N. 
These  adjustments  must  respect  stress,  geometric  limits  and  frequency 
limits. Specifically, each algorithm has undergone several individual tests, 
and then we calculated the average of the best Physical Condition (MBF) 
to evaluate the performance. Finally, MBF, representing the average of the 
maximum values of all trials, is shown in the graph for direct comparison.

of the gearbox under mechanical and geometric constraints. By adjusting 
the gear size, shaft diameter and component layout, we can reduce material 
usage and production costs without sacrificing structural integrity or service 
life.

Our experimental results show that EPLO can be effective in identifying 
high  quality  solutions  and  maintaining  consistent  performance  across 
numerous  tests.  In  the  case  of  the  tension/compression  spring  (TCSD) 
design  problem,  the  improved  algorithm  (EPLO)  achieved  low  physical 
fitness  values in  most operations,  showing  strong exploration ability  and 
rapid convergence. In addition, its robustness is confirmed by the fact that 
it has always achieved low average fitness values with minimal standard 
deviation in independent tests. However, transient fluctuations in the mean 
convergence curve during periods of sharp decline suggest that the pattern 
of  adaptive  parameters  can  be  improved  to  mitigate  late  degradation. 
Ultimately,  the  optimized  design  allows  for  low  weight  (or  cost 
effectiveness) while respecting all mechanical and geometric constraints. 
Overall, these results highlight the practical application of EPLO in the task 
of optimizing engineering design. 
4.2 Reducer Design Issues 
4.2.1 Problem Background and Motivation 

We emphasize that the transmission is a fundamental element of the 
powertrain  system  in  the  automotive,  aerospace,  manufacturing  and 
metallurgical  industries.  Its  core  function  is  to  reduce  the  input  speed 
through  gear  meshing  while  increasing  the  torque  to  meet  the  required 
speed  and  torque  requirements.  Optimizing  the  transmission  design 
requires balancing transmission efficiency, load capacity, floor space, mass 

We note that reducer design must satisfy a range of strength, stiffness, 
and geometric bounds to ensure safety, stability, and feasibility.Specifically, 
tooth-root  bending  stress must not exceed  the  material‚Äôs  allowable  limit, 
and  surface-contact  stress  must  stay  below  the  pitting  threshold. 
Additionally,  we  control  lateral  shaft  deflection  under  load  to  maintain 
accurate meshing and limit the resulting torsional and bending stresses in 
the  shafts.  We  also  impose  minimum  and  maximum  bounds  on  key 
dimensions such as module size, face width, and shaft diameter. Finally, 
the tooth count must be an integer that conforms to established gear-design 
standards. 

In metaheuristic algorithms, the penalty function method is frequently 
employed  to  address  inequality  constraints.  If  a  solution  z  violates  any 
constraint ùëîùëñ(z)‚â?, a sufficiently large penalty term is incorporated into the 
objective function. This addition serves to diminish the competitiveness of 
non-compliant  solutions  during  the search process, thereby  ensuring that 
the final solution adheres to all specified constraints. The fitness function 
associated with this penalty function method can be expressed as follows:

In the study of experimental processes and outcomes, the problem is 
initially defined with the objective function aimed at minimizing the weight 
of the reducer. Constraints are established, including gear bending stress, 
surface pressure, shaft deflection and stress, as well as geometric upper and 
lower 
as 
z= [ùëß1, ùëß2, ùëß3, ùëß4, ùëß5, ùëß6, ùëß7]T .  Subsequently,  improved  Particle  Swarm 
Optimization  (EPLO)  along  with  other  meta-heuristic  algorithms  are 
employed to address this problem[1]. These methods are compared against 
algorithms  such  as  Particle  Swarm  Optimization  (PLO),  Grey  Wolf 
Optimizer  (GWO),  and  Whale  Optimization  Algorithm  (WOA).  During 
experimentation,  hyperparameters‚Äîincluding  population  size,  maximum

Our  experiments  have  shown  that  EPLO  is  effective  in  identifying 
optimal  configurations  in  a  short  computation  time  and  provides 
consistently  reproducible  results  across  numerous  tests.  Analysis  of  the 
speed  reducer  design  experiments  shows  that  the  EPLO  has  a  high 
exploration  capability,  fine  setting  accuracy  and  strategic  capability  to 
avoid  local  optimum.  Compared  to  conventional  optimization  methods, 
EPLO  convergence  is  fast  and  the  final  solution  is  better.  The  small 
standard  deviation  of  the  EPLO  results  over  30  independent  operations 
indicates  that  the  algorithm  has  high  robustness  and  stability,  which  is 
crucial for the engineering design.

In  conclusion,  our  experiments  confirm  that  the  improved  EPLO

4.3 Gear Train Problems 
4.3.1 Problem Background and Motivation 

Gear  systems  are  widely  used  in  mechanical  engineering  for  power 
transfer and speed/torque change. A rational design of the number of teeth 
reduces  material  and  manufacturing  costs  or  improves  transmission 
efficiency  while  meeting  the  specific  needs  of  the  transmission  ratio.  In 
some cases, choosing the right number of teeth in a given range is enough 
to achieve the desired transmission ratio and minimize errors or costs. Since 
the problem usually concerns only a small number of variables (number of 
speeds) and has no complex constraints, it is very appropriate to check the 
search power and the convergence speed of the different metaheuristics on 
small scale problems without additional constraints. 

4.3.2 Design variables and objective function 

Fig. 6. Design Issues of Gear Train 

Assume that there are four gears with the number of teeth of ùë•1, ùë•2, ùë•3, 
ùë•4  respectively.  In  many  practical  applications,  these  gears  are  used  to 
achieve  a  specified  transmission  ratio  or  reduce  transmission  cost/error. 
According  to  the  mathematical  model  provided  in  the  question,  the 
objective function of the gear system can be written as: 

Assume there are four gears with the number of teeth represented by 
ùë•1Ôºåùë?Ôºåùë?and ùë•4, respectively. In numerous practical applications, these 
gears are employed to achieve a specified transmission ratio or to minimize 
transmission costs and errors. Based on the mathematical model provided 
in the question, the objective function for the gear system can be expressed 
as follows: 

(33) 

Where  x=[ùë•1, ùë•2, ùë•3, ùë•4]T represents  the  number  of  teeth  of  the  four 
 indicating  that  the  actual  gear  ratio  or  the  related  coefficient 

gears, ùë•2√óùë•3
ùë•1√óùë•4

 is  the  expected  target  value  or  reference  value,  which  measures  the 
6.931
deviation  between  the  actual  value and the  target  value.  The  smaller  the 
objective  function,  the  more  accurately  the  gear  train  can  achieve  the 
required  transmission  ratio  or  reduce  the  corresponding  transmission 
cost/error. 
4.3.3 Experimental process and results 

We  selected  the  enhanced  EPLO  algorithm  alongside  benchmark 
methods  such  as  PLO,  PSO,  and  GWO  for  evaluation.  We  set 
hyperparameters‚Äîincluding  population  size,  maximum  iterations,  and 
variable bounds‚Äîand applied rounding or discrete‚Äêencoding when discrete 
outputs were required. Next, we ran each algorithm independently for 30 
trials. In each trial, we recorded the best fitness, tracked the convergence 
curve, and saved the optimal solution vector x = [ùë•1, ùë•2, ùë•3, ùë•4]T. Finally, 
we performed data analysis to compute the mean best fitness (MBF) and 
standard  deviation  (STD)  for  each  method  on  the  gear‚Äêtrain  problem, 
assessing  both  solution  quality  and  consistency,  and  we  plotted 
convergence curves to compare each algorithm‚Äôs convergence speed.

4.4.1 Problem Background and Motivation 

Multi-disc clutch brakes are widely used in automotive transmission 
systems  and  industrial  machinery.  Their  lightweight  design  is  of  great 
significance  for  reducing  energy  consumption,  improving  efficiency  and 
reducing manufacturing costs. As shown in Figure 2, the design problem 
requires  optimizing  parameters  such  as  inner  radius,  outer  radius,  disc 
thickness, force and number of friction surfaces to minimize the brake mass 
while satisfying nine nonlinear constraints such as pressure, thermal load 
and geometric compatibility.

Overall, the experimental results for gearing design problems showed 
that  the  EPLO  achieved  low  average  final  fitting  values  over  30 
independent  operations,  which  shows  that  it  succeeded  in  minimising 
transmission  ratio  errors.  The  small  standard  deviation  of  the  poolp 
indicates  more  stable and  robust  results.  The average convergence  curve 
shows that the poop decreases rapidly and stabilizes throughout the iteration, 
fully  demonstrating  the  effective  combination  of  its  global  research  and 
local  development  capabilities.  These  results  verified  the  feasibility  and 
practical  usefulness  of  the  modified  EPLO  algorithm  to  address  mixed 
integer non-linear optimization problems, such as gear design. Therefore, 
EPLO code performance in gearing design optimization has demonstrated 
its  ability  to  effectively  reduce  transmission  ratio  errors  and  improve 
transmission  accuracy  while  respecting  different  design  constraints.  In 
addition,  it  has  obvious  advantages  in  terms  of  stability  of  results  and 
calculation efficiency. This provides strong support to improve traditional 
designs  by  adopting  intelligent  optimization  methods  in  engineering 
practice.

The decision variables are represented by five integer values, denoted

the  disk  t  (mm), ùë•4 denotes  the  applied  force  F(N),  and ùë•5 signifies  the 
number of friction surfaces Z (integer). The total mass is determined by the 
geometric volume and material density, with an objective to minimize this 
value.

4.4.4. Experimental process and result analysis 

In the process of applying the algorithm, we start by initializing the 
parameters,  defining  the  correlation  constants  according  to  the  design 
requirements  and  determining  the  upper  and  lower  limits  of  the  design 
variables,  indicating  whether  to  take  an  integer.  Then  an  appropriate 
optimization algorithm (e.g. EPLO, GA, PSO, HHO, etc.) is selected for a 
global search and parameters such as population size, maximum number of 
iterations, etc. On stress handling, the penalty function method is used to 
penalize  solutions  that  violate  constraints  and  integer  variables  are 
processed  by  rounding  or  mixed  coding.  In  an  iterative  search,  the 
population is initialized randomly, the value of the objective function and 
the violation of constraints are calculated, and the optimal individuals are 
iteratively  updated until  the termination condition  is  met.  In  the  end,  the 
optimal  solution  and  the  corresponding  mass  are  produced  and  the 
constraints are checked to verify the plausibility of the action force and the 
number  of  discs.  At  the  same  time,  mass  reduction  and  performance 
improvement  are  analyzed  compared  to  traditional  or  initial  design.  The 
standard  deviation  (STD)  to  assess  the  stability  and  convergence  of  the 
curve  shows  a  downward  trend  in  the  quality  as  much  as  possible  the 
percentage  change  in  the  situation  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the 
impunity function.

The  results  show  that  the  EPLO  algorithm  can  further  reduce  the 
quality of the clutch brake by 10-20% provided it meets the requirements 
of contact pressure, slip speed and torque, and put the action force F and 
the  number  of  discs  Z  within  a  reasonable  range,  which  shows  that  the 
improved algorithm has obvious advantages and feasibility in the optimized 
design  of  the  multi-disc  clutch  brake.  Multiple  disc  clutch  brake  design 
problems involve many geometric, mechanical and assembly parameters. It 
is necessary to minimize the quality of the structure while guaranteeing the 
torque  capacity  and  safety  margins.  An  optimal  design  solution  can  be 
quickly  found  in  a  multivariate  and  highly  coupled  environment  by 
constructing 
the  corresponding  objective  function  with  non-linear 
constraints  and  using  the  EPLO  algorithm  for  a  global  search.  The 
experimental  results  show  that  the  improved  algorithm  can  effectively 
reduce the quality of the clutch and brake under the condition of meeting 
the action force and safety constraints, which provides an idea of efficient 
and viable optimization for the industrial field in terms of energy saving 
and emission reduction and performance improvement. 
4.5 Planetary Gear Train Design Optimization Problem 
4.5.1 Problem Background and Motivation 

The  planetary  gear  train  is  the  core  component  of  the  automobile 
gearbox.  Its  transmission  ratio  accuracy  directly  affects  the  power 
transmission efficiency and driving smoothness. As shown in Figure 5, this 
problem  requires  the  optimization  of  6  integer  variables  (number  of 
teeth,ùëÅ1 ‚àºùë?)  and  module ùëö1, ùëö3,  number  of  poles  p,  to  minimize  the 
maximum  error  of  the  transmission  ratio  while  satisfying  11  geometric 
compatibilities, assembly conditions and strength constraints[4]. Traditional 
design relies on trial and error, while mixed integer nonlinear optimization 
algorithms can significantly improve design efficiency and accuracy.

4.5.3 Experimental process and result analysis 

Initially,  algorithm  parameters  are  initialized,  including  defining 
integer ranges for gear tooth counts (ùëÅ1 to ùëÅ6), predefined discrete sets for 
module values (ùëö1 and ùëö3), and the permissible range for pole pairs (p). 
Concurrently, the target gear ratio and associated design constraints (e.g., 
strength, geometry, and assembly requirements) are defined. Subsequently, 
suitable  optimization  algorithms ‚Ä?such  as  EPLO  (Particle  Population 
Learning  Optimization)  and  PSO  (Particle  Swarm  Optimization) ‚Ä?are 
selected to address the problem. Discrete variables are handled via rounding 
or  index-mapping  techniques  to  ensure  integer  feasibility.  Constraint 
handling employs either a penalty function approach or a feasibility-first 
strategy  to  ensure  solution  validity.  An  initial  population  is  randomly 
generated, and each individual's objective function value and fitness score 
are  computed.  The  algorithm  iteratively  updates  the  best  candidate 
solutions  until 
iterations  or 
termination  criteria  (e.g.,  maximum 
convergence tolerance) are met. To ensure statistical robustness, multiple 
independent  runs  are  executed  to  compute  the  mean  best  fitness  (MBF), 
standard deviation (STD), and convergence curves. These metrics confirm 
compliance  with  all  assembly,  strength,  and  geometric  constraints  in  the 
final  solution.  Finally,  the  proposed  method  is  benchmarked  against 
conventional  methods  to  quantify  improvements  in  transmission  ratio 
accuracy  and  evaluate  the  feasible  solution  rate.  These  metrics  further 
assess algorithmic stability and search efficiency.

Experimental  tests  show  that  the  EPLO  algorithm  reliably  finds 
superior configurations, cutting transmission‚Äêratio errors from about 0.15 
down to nearly 0.02. Moreover, the chosen tooth counts and module sizes 
fully  satisfy  all  design  constraints,  demonstrating  the  method‚Äôs  strong 
global‚Äêsearch ability and robustness in refining planetary‚Äêgear‚Äêtrain layouts. 
Planetary  wheel  design  optimization  problems  are  related  to  the 
dispersion of the number of teeth and the module, as well as multiple non-
linear  assembly  and  strength  constraints.  By  integrating  into  the  unified 
model  the  key  variables  (number  of  poles,  number  of  teeth,  number  of 
modules) and the  requirements of the  transmission  ratio of  the  planetary 
wheels, and by performing a global search with EPLO, transmission ratio 
errors  can  be  significantly  reduced,  while  respecting  the  geometry  and 
strength constraints of the connection. Experimental results show that the 
EPLO algorithm converges rapidly to a high quality solution in a discrete-
continuous mixing space, reduces the trial and error process and improves 
design  accuracy.  It  provides  an  efficient  and  viable  technical  path  for 
lightweight,  high-precision  planetary  wheel  design  in  areas  such  as 
automotive gearboxes and industrial robots.

stability of the capture. Figure 5 shows schematically a typical structure of 
a manipulator clamp: the opening and closing of the clamp and the transfer 
of  the  gripping  force  are  achieved  by  a  number  of  links  with  the  drive 
mechanism. Traditional designs often rely on experience or trial and error 
methods  to  meet  basic  gripping  needs.  However,  with  the  increasing 
demand  for  various  object  gripping  and  high  precision  control,  gripper 
lightness,  stroke  flexibility  and  gripping  flexibility  are  becoming  key 
considerations.  Metaheuristics  based  global  search  and  multi-purpose 
balancing capabilities enable the efficient extraction of more optimal clamp 
structure parameters in larger non-linear stress environments. 

hyperparameters  such  as  population  size  and  maximum  number  of 
iterations  are  set.  Constraint  processing  uses  penalty  function  method  or 
feasibility priority strategy to ensure the feasibility of the solution, and at 
the same time determines the maximum and minimum values of the force 
through numerical search or analytical calculation. In the iterative search 
stage, the feasible solution is initialized and the algorithm is updated, and 
the  solution  is  optimized  by  crossover,  mutation  or  speed  and  position 
adjustment  until  convergence.  The  experimental  analysis  is  carried  out 
through multiple independent runs, statistical average best fitness (MBF) 
and  standard  deviation  (STD),  and  the  convergence  curve  is  drawn  to 
evaluate the performance of the algorithm under nonlinear mechanics and 
geometric  constraints,  and  verify  whether the optimal  solution  meets  the 
key  constraints.  Finally,  compared  with  the  traditional  solution,  the 
reduction  of  clamping  force  fluctuation  and  the  solution  effect  of  the 
algorithm are evaluated.

the  EPLO  algorithm 
consistently  achieves  minimal ùêπùëòvalue  ranges  (max(ùêπùëò)‚àímin(ùêπùëò))  across 
multiple  runs  while  satisfying  all  constraints.  This  underscores  the 
algorithm's strong applicability in robotic gripper structural optimization. 
Compared to traditional trial-and-error manual methods or heuristic design 
approaches, this technique significantly reduces gripping force variability, 
thereby enhancing operational stability and efficiency.  

10 

The  problem  of  optimizing  the  design  of  robotic  pliers  involves 
variable  geometric  and  kinematic  parameters,  as  well  as  a  number  of 
mechanical and geometric stresses and the objective function often has to 
look for the maximum/minimum value of the gripping force over a certain 
interval  z‚àà[0, Zùëöùëéùë• ]  to  measure  the  fluctuations.  Thanks  to  the  overall 
search capability of the EPLO algorithm, it is possible to quickly converge 
to an optimal solution in a high dimensional and non-linear environment, 
which reduces fluctuations in grip force over the entire travel range, while 
ensuring  the  requirements  of  the  travel  and  force  range.  Experimental 
results  show  that  this  method  can  effectively  respond  to  the  design  of 
complex mechanical structures and offers an efficient and viable technical 
path for the needs of robotic clamp in terms of lightness, high precision and 
multifunctionality. 

Overall, the experimental results concerning the optimization problem 
of the design of robotic pliers have fully demonstrated the feasibility and 
value  of  engineering  applications  of  the  modified  EPLO  algorithm.  The 
EPLO can quickly locate the area of excellent design and effectively reduce 
the fluctuations of gripping force. In subsequent phases of convergence, the 
EPLO  performs  fine  research using adaptive  strategies to  ensure  that the 
design  solution  meets  the  constraints.  Through  the  statistical  analysis  of 
several  independent  operations,  the  EPLO  showed  a  small  fluctuation  in 
results,  adapted  to  the  repeatability  requirements  in  actual  engineering 
designs. This study verified the excellent performance of EPLO in complex, 
multi-variable and multi-stress engineering problems, such as robotic pliers. 
It provides an efficient and reliable optimization tool for practical designs. 
5  UAV dynamically avoid obstacles and plan routes in 3D 

With the in-depth application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms 
in disaster rescue, environmental monitoring, and intelligent logistics, the 
complexity  and  dynamics  of  the  airspace  environment  are  constantly 
increasing. Traditional path planning methods often assume that obstacles 
are  stationary  and  known.  However,  in  actual  tasks,  unmanned  aerial 
vehicles  (UAVs)  need  to  deal  with  real-time  detected  moving  obstacles, 
emergency  areas,  and  potential  conflicts  with  other  UAVs  or  manned 
aircraft[47].  In  addition, the coordinated  operation or  formation  flight of 
multiple  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  (UAVs)  requires  maximizing  mission 
efficiency and minimizing the overall completion time while ensuring the 
safety of their respective trajectories[48]. It is necessary not only to have 
the online obstacle avoidance capability to deal with the frequent updates 
of  dynamic  threat  zones,  but  also  to  achieve  conflict  detection  and 
collaborative  scheduling  in  a  multi-drone  environment.  To  address  the 
above  issues,  this  study  proposes  a  multi-path  and  multi-UAV  real-time 
dynamic obstacle avoidance and scheduling framework based on density 
clustering and  meta-heuristic  optimization  (EPLO).  Firstly,  the  terrain of 
Xiaozhu  Mountain  area  in  Huangdao,  China  is  selected  for  partial 
extraction. The system collects the obstacle point cloud in real time through 
airborne  sensors  and  ground  stations,  and  uses  the  improved  DBSCAN 
algorithm[49] to extract the Xiaozhu Mountain dataset online and merge 
the dynamic threat area. Subsequently, for each preset flight mission, a safe 
initial flight path is generated by combining Dijkstra's shortest path and B-
spline  smoothing  techniques;  Then,  the  path  optimization  objective 
function is constructed by introducing perturbation variables, and the EPLO 
algorithm  combining  particle  swarm  and  local  learning  is  adopted  to 
globally optimize the track. Finally, based on the frame-by-frame conflict 
detection results, the takeoff delay scheduling vector is introduced, and the 
EPLO  algorithm  is  utilized  to  minimize  the  task  completion  delay  of 
multiple unmanned aerial vehicles under the premise of ensuring safety[50]. 
5.1 Mathematical Model 
In this section, we present the mathematical formulation of the proposed 
EPLO-based  UAV path  planning  framework.  The  model  consists  of  five 

interconnected  modules:  threat  modeling,  path  generation,  conflict 
detection, scheduling optimization, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. 
5.1.1 Threat Modeling 
We model the operating domain as a Euclidean region 
(full 3D). 
Threats are represented as a set of time-varying circular/ball regions (for 
at continuous time 
2D/3D respectively). For each threat index 
t, the threat zone is: 

Where 

is  the  center  of  threat  k  at  time  t, 

(61) 

is  the 

effective radius,

is the dimension. 

Threat motion is modeled by a simple kinematic model with possible 

boundary reflection: for time step Œît, 

A hard safety requirement for a UAV position p(t) is: 

(62) 

(63) 

Where 

denotes the planar projection of p (if n=3) and Œ∑>0 is the 

design safety margin. 
The global threat set is: 

(64) 

5.1.2 Path Feasibility Graph Model 

We discretize the planning topology by constructing a candidate node 

set V and feasible edge set E.  

(65) 

Nodes  consist  of:  start  point  s,  goal  point  g,  tangent/sample  points 
generated around threat boundaries, for each threat k, sample L points on 
(offset),  where  Œ¥  is  an  exploration  offset,  and 
the  circle  of  radius 

define the undirected weighted graph G=(V,E,W) where edge (u,v)‚ààE iff 
,c) 
the straight-line segment 

does not intersect any threat, where dist(

denotes the minimum Euclidean distance between the line segment 
point c. The edge weight is Euclidean length: 

and 

(66) 

A  feasible  shortest  discrete  path  from  s  to  g  is  found  by  running 

Dijkstra (or A*) on G: 

(67) 

In dynamic-threat scenarios, the feasibility of an edge should take into 
account the time-varying threat envelope encountered while the edge would 
be  traversed  (i.e.,  the  worst  case).  One  may  define  a  maximal-radius 
or  perform  explicit  time-varying  checks.  If  there  exists  any 
envelope 

time  t  such  that 

,then  the  edge  (u,v)  is  considered 

infeasible. After obtaining the discrete path, a continuous trajectory P(t) is 
constructed by spline interpolation. 
5.1.3 Trajectory Optimization EPLO Model 

After generating an initial continuous feasible trajectory 

for each 

UAV,  we  apply  a  trajectory-  and  schedule-aware  optimizer  ‚Ä? EPLO 
(Parallel Particle-based Learning Optimizer) ‚Ä?to refine trajectories and to 
perform  scheduling  search.  EPLO  is  an  evolutionary/particle-based 
optimizer with the following mathematical elements. 

For each UAV i with a discretized trajectory of 

sample waypoints, 

we denote the waypoint matrix:

5.3 Datasets Analysis and Comparison 
5.3.1 Comparison of Path Planning Effects 
In the UAV path planning code, the clustering process is mainly used to 
extract  meaningful  threat  zones  from  the  original  obstacle  point  cloud, 
providing  a  basis  for  subsequent  path  planning  and  obstacle  avoidance. 
Firstly,  the  code  reads  the  dynamic  obstacle  dataset  from  a  CSV  file, 
extracts the detected obstacle points, converts the latitude, longitude, and 
altitude information into Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) representing east, 
north, and altitude directions through coordinate transformation, and then 
normalizes  these  coordinates  to  eliminate  the  influence  of  dimensions. 
the  DBSCAN  (Density-Based  Spatial  Clustering  of 
Subsequently, 
Applications  with  Noise)  algorithm  is  used  for  clustering,  with  the 
neighborhood  radius  eps=0.35  and  the  minimum  number  of  core  points 
minPts=3.  Points  that  are  density-connected  are  grouped  into  the  same 
cluster by calculating distances  between points,  while  isolated points  are 
marked as noise. For each valid cluster, the code restores the cluster points 
to the original scale, calculates the cluster center on the XY plane, and takes 
the maximum distance from points within the cluster to the center plus a 
15-meter safety margin as the radius of the threat zone; for noise points, 
they are individually treated as small threat zones with a radius of 10 meters. 
To optimize the distribution  of threat  zones, the  code  further performs  a 
merging  operation  to  remove  small  zones  completely  contained  within 
larger threat zones, and ensures the number of threat zones remains within 
a reasonable range of 5-8 through random addition or screening. The final 
generated threat zones are used for obstacle avoidance planning in UAV 
paths.  This  experiment  conducts  multi-UAV  path  planning  tests  in  a 
complex dynamic threat environment. The environment consists of 8 threat 
zones, with the radius of the threat zones ranging from 10 to 45 meters and 
the  moving  speed  of  dynamic  threats  ranging  from  0.5  to  2.0  m/s.  The 
system deploys 6 drones, divided into three paths, with a safety distance set 
at  15  meters.  The  parameters  of  the  EPLO  algorithm  are  set  as  follows: 
population  size  20,  maximum  iteration  500  times,  4  parallel  subclusters, 
elite pool size 5, migration cycle 20 generations. 
The  comprehensive  performance  of  four  path  generation  methods  was 
compared: A* algorithm, RRT, traditional PSO optimizer, and the dynamic 
clustering + EPLO optimizer proposed in this paper (referred to as DEPLO). 
The performance indicators are as follows Table 7:

The three drones on Path 1 have delays of 0, 15, and 28 frames respectively, 
creating a takeoff time difference and effectively avoiding conflicts within 
the  same path.  The  UAV6 on path  3  has  the  highest  delay,  avoiding  the 
peak flight periods of Path 1 and Path 2. Path 3 has the longest delay but 
the highest delay. Conflicts are avoided by exchanging time for space, and 
all  tasks  are  completed  at  158  frames.  It  is  22.6%  less  than  random 
scheduling. 
Fig. 14 shows the results of collaborative path planning for six unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) in eight threat zones. All drone trajectories are kept 
at a safe distance from the threat area. For instance, UAV1 has mapped out 
a smooth detour path between the threat zones T1 and T6, with a minimum 
spacing  of  25  meters.  Three  paths  are  respectively  allocated  3,  2  and  1 
unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  with  path  lengths  of  320m,  280m  and  250m 
respectively.  Path1's  UAV1-3  adopts  differentiated  latency  to  avoid 
conflicts within the queue. B-spline curve processing significantly reduces 
path turning points. For instance, the waypoints of Path2 are reduced from 
the initial 12 to a continuous curve of a smooth path, and the turning Angle 
is lowered from an average of 90¬∞ to below 45¬∞.

Fig.  15  captures  the  dynamic  obstacle  avoidance  scene  at  frame  270, 
highlighting the algorithm's response capability to mobile threats, with the 
red threat moving in the direction of the arrow. When UAV8 approaches 
T1,  it  triggers  a  vertical  climb,  and  the  real-time  obstacle  avoidance 
distance drops from 82 meters to the safe value of 105 meters. The original 
trajectory distance between UAV4 and UAV5 during frames 150-160 was 
only 8m. Through delay scheduling, the actual distance was increased to 
23m. The black dashed box indicates that the threat rebounded within a 50-
meter boundary margin without affecting the drone's flight path. Dynamic 
threat  detection  and  re-planning  mechanism  enable  the  unmanned  aerial 
vehicle to trigger an average of only 0.33 emergency evasive maneuvers, 
significantly reducing the computational load.

The Fig. 16 show that EPLO achieves three-stage intelligent convergence 
through a hierarchical hybrid strategy. The early-stage migration operation 
accelerates global exploration, the mid-stage Levy flight breaks through the 
stagnation  point,  and  the  late-stage  gradient  descent  fine-tuning.  In 
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) scheduling, its 120-degree fitness solution 
reduces the maximum completion time of six UAVs in a dynamic threat 
environment to 12.4 seconds, with zero conflicts occurring. The horizontal 
stability  at  the  end  of  the  curve  (change  <0.1%  after  substituting  350) 
confirms  that  the  algorithm  solution  has  approached  the  Pareto  frontier, 
providing a theoretical guarantee for large-scale cluster applications.

6.  Node  localization  method  for  three-dimensional  wireless  sensor 
networks 

Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of a large number 
of low-power and low-cost sensor nodes and are widely used in fields such 
as  environmental  monitoring, target tracking,  and  smart home[51].  Node 
location  is  one  of  the  key  technologies  in  WSN,  providing  necessary 
location  information  support  for  the  network[52].  In  three-dimensional 
environments,  such  as  mountain  monitoring,  Marine  exploration,  and 
indoor positioning, node positioning faces greater challenges. 

Traditional  range-based  positioning  technologies  such  as  RSSI[53], 
TOA[54], TDOA and AOA[55], although they have high accuracy, require 
additional hardware support, increasing the cost and energy consumption 
of  nodes.  In  non-ranging  and  positioning  technologies,  the  DV-Hop 
algorithm has been widely applied due to its advantages such as simplicity 
and  ease  of  implementation,  and  no  reliance  on  additional  hardware. 
However,  the  DV-Hop  algorithm  has  the  following  problems  in  a  three-
dimensional  environment:  the  uneven  distribution  of  nodes  in  three-
dimensional  space  leads  to  inaccurate  estimation  of  the  average  hop 
distance,  the  three-dimensional  environment  is  complex,  and  signal 
propagation is greatly affected by the environment, when the anchor nodes 
are unevenly distributed, the error in solving the node coordinates by the 
least squares method is relatively large. In response to the above problems, 
researchers  have proposed  a variety of  DV-Hop algorithms  improved  by 
intelligent  optimization  algorithms  in  recent  years,  such  as  PSO-DV-
Hop[56],  GWO-DV-Hop[57]  and  WOA-DV-Hop[58],  etc.  These 
algorithms have improved the positioning accuracy to a certain extent, but 
there  are  still  problems  such  as  premature  convergence  and  insufficient 
global exploration ability. 
6.1 EPLO-DV-Hop positioning algorithm 

The overall framework of the EPLO-DV-HOP algorithm first involves 
network  initialization and  DV-Hop  information collection, calculation of 
the average Hop distance of anchor nodes, estimation of the distance from 
unknown nodes to anchor nodes, EPLO optimization of the coordinates of 
unknown nodes, and evaluation and output of positioning results. 

In a three-dimensional WSN, there are N nodes, among which M are 
anchor nodes whose positions are known. There are N to M unknown nodes 
that  need  to  be  located.  The  steps  of  the  three-dimensional  DV-Hop 
algorithm are as follows: 

Calculate the Euclidean distance matrix between nodes: 

(74) 

The Euclidean distance between nodes is defined as above. Here 

is the true Euclidean distance between node iii and node j;

 and

 are  their 3-D coordinates.  This is  the  standard 3-D  Euclidean 

distance  used  to  form  the  distance  matrix  employed  in  hop-count 
calculations and average hop-size estimation. 

Communication  radius  Under  ùëÖ,  the  hop  matrix  is  approximated 

discretized: 

(75) 

Under  communication  radius  R,  hop  counts  are  approximated  by
 denotes minimal hop count from node i to j, and R 

. Here

is  communication  radius. This  assumes  an  idealized per-hop  reach  of R; 
however, environmental non-idealities motivate using averaged hop-size to 
correct this approximation. 

(76) 

For each anchor k we compute an average hop-size: the sum of true 
distances  between  anchor  k  and  other  anchors  divided  by  the  sum  of 
corresponding  hop  counts.  Here  M  is  number  of  anchors.  The  hop  size 
estimates the average metric distance per hop and is used to convert hop 
counts from unknown nodes into physical distance estimates. 

Then the estimated distance from the unknown node ùë¢ to the anchor 

node ùëò is adopted: 

(77) 

Here, 

is the hop count from the unknown node ùë¢ to the anchor node ùëò,

and 

is  the  estimated  distance.  The  conversion  from  hop  count  to 

physical distance in  this  estimation  depends on the local  structure of  the 
anchor  points.  By  combining  the  estimations  of  all  anchor  points, 
observational data and weighted residuals can be provided for subsequent 
positioning optimization. 
To refine unknown node coordinates under DV-Hop distance constraints, 
we define a weighted normalized fitness function: 

This  Fig.  17  compares  the  average  positioning  error  (ALE)  of  four 
algorithms  (DV-Hop,  WOA-DV-Hop,  GWO-DV-Hop,  and  EPLO-DV-
Hop). ALE normalizes the communication radius and plots it as the pole 
height. Considering the EPLO wrapper, the significant reduction in EPLO 
bars indicates that the subpopulation and exchange architecture of EPLO 
improve  global  search,  and  the  integrated  restart  combined  with  local 
refinement  reduces  randomness  and  local  capture,  jointly  lowering  the 
average error. 

(78) 

To transform localization into an optimization, we define the weighted 
normalized  fitness  function  above.  Here  x  is  the  candidate 3-D estimate, 
are  anchor 

 are  anchor  coordinates, 

are  estimated  distances,

weights, Œª is a penalty coefficient, and 
penalizes boundary violations. 
The  first  term  is  a  weighted  squared  relative  residual,  preventing  large 
absolute  distances  from  dominating  the  objective;  weights  favor  more 
reliable  anchors.  The  penalty  term  ensures  feasible  physical  solutions 
within the predefined search box.Anchor weights are defined as an inverse 
function of hop count: 

(79) 

with small œµ epsilonœµ to avoid division by zero. The rationale is that 
larger  hop  counts  typically  indicate  higher  uncertainty  in  the  distance 
estimate;  therefore  such  anchors  should  contribute  less  to  the  objective, 
while anchors with fewer hops receive larger weight.The boundary penalty 
term adopts a component-by-component quadratic penalty form to restrict 
the solution domain in a soft constraint manner: 

(80) 

The main indicator for evaluating positioning performance is the mean 
positioning error (ALE), defined as follows: 

(81) 

The primary performance metric is Average Localization Error (ALE) 
 true 

defined as above. U is number of unknown nodes, 

the estimate, 

coordinate,  and  R  communication  radius.  ALE  normalizes  errors  by  R, 
facilitating  comparisons  across  connectivity  regimes.  Standard  deviation 
reflects  stability, and  convergence  curves  exhibit  convergence  speed and 
late-stage refinement ability. 
6.2 Simulation experiment settings 

Generate N=100 uniformly random nodes inside a 100√ó100√ó100 cube  
and randomly select M=20 anchors. Set communication radius R=30 m. For 
each unknown node, run the optimizer independently to obtain estimated 
coordinates.  Repeat  each  algorithm  30  independent  runs  with  different 
random initial populations.

Fig. 18. Box plot of positioning error 

The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), and the median and 
outliers can visually reflect the error distribution and the number of outliers 
of  the  algorithm  at  different nodes. The  analysis of  the  positioning  error 
distribution in Fig. 18 shows that the PPO-DV-HOP algorithm exhibits the 
best performance, with a median of only 1.8 m, the smallest IQR, an error 
distribution limited to 0.3-3.2 m, and the box height is significantly lower 
than that of other algorithms, indicating that it has both high precision and 
stability.  Statistical  tests  showed  that  there  was  a  significant  difference 
(p<0.01) in the error distribution of PPO-DV-Hop compared with the other 
algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the particle swarm optimization 
strategy in reducing multi-hop positioning errors.

comprehensive performance of the EPLO-DV-Hop algorithm is superior to 
the other three methods, while the DV-Hop and WOA-DV-Hop algorithms

problems  through  the  global  search  strategy.  Its  dynamic  parameter 
adjustment  mechanism  can  compensate  for  the  nonlinear  propagation 
influence  of  multi-peak  terrain,  achieving  an  error  reduction  of  43.75% 
(1.8m  vs  3.2m)  in  the  peak  area,  and  optimizing  path  planning  through 
three-dimensional  gradient  descent  in  the  slope  area.  Stabilize  the 
positioning deviation below the fitness value of 0.05 (compared with 0.15 
of  DV-Hop).  In  addition,  EPLO's  adaptive  processing  ability  for  local 
elevation changes (such as fusing terrain gradient information of multi-hop 
paths) enables it to maintain high positioning accuracy at terrain edges with 
sparse  node  distribution  (with  less  than  3  adjacent  nodes),  verifying  its 
superiority in multi-peak and complex environments.

Fig. 20. A single-peak terrain surface map with nodes 

In Fig. 20, on the single-peak terrain surface, the distribution of anchor 
nodes  (red)  and  unknown  nodes  (blue)  shows  significant  spatial 
heterogeneity.  Among  them,  the  nodes  in  the  slope  and  peak  areas  are 
significantly  more  sensitive  to  Hop  estimation  and  distance  errors  than 
those  in  the  flat  areas.  Nodes  located  at  the  edge  of  the  terrain  have 
insufficient  numbers  of  adjacent  nodes,  resulting  in  the  loss  of  local 
connectivity  in  Hop estimation.  However, due to the excessive elevation 
difference between the peak and the base, the distance measurement of the 
node  is  affected  by  the  nonlinearity  of  the  terrain  undulation,  and  the 
cumulative  error  can  reach  2.3  times  that  of  the  traditional  method.  The 
EPLO-DV-Hop algorithm demonstrates significant advantages in complex 
terrains.  Its  global  search  strategy,  through  dynamic  optimization  in  the 
three-dimensional  parameter  space,  effectively  avoids the  local optimum 
trap.  This  algorithm  compensates  for  the  non-uniform  propagation 
environment of slope nodes by introducing terrain gradient weight factors, 
thereby achieving more accurate positioning solutions in three-dimensional 
space.

Table  10 delineates the  impact  of  the  total number of nodes on  the 
localization  accuracy  across  unimodal  and  multimodal  terrains.  The 
proposed  EPLO-DV-Hop  algorithm  consistently  demonstrates  superior 
performance, achieving the lowest Average Localization Error (ALE) in 10 
out of the 12 test scenarios. Notably, in unimodal terrain, EPLO-DV-Hop 
sustains  an  ALE  below  2.0  across  all  node  densities,  with  its  best 
performance  (ALE  =  1.5321)  observed  at  250  nodes.  This  stability 
underscores the algorithm's robustness against variations in network scale. 
In  the  more  challenging  multimodal  terrain,  EPLO-DV-Hop  maintains  a 
significant  lead, particularly at  higher  node  counts  (300 nodes),  where it 
achieves  an  ALE  of  1.7403,  outperforming  the  second-best  algorithm 
(WOA-DV-Hop, ALE=2.1695) by approximately 20%. This performance 
advantage  is  attributed  to  EPLO's  enhanced  parallel  search  strategy  and 
refined  exploitation  mechanism,  which  effectively  navigate  complex 
solution  spaces  and  mitigate  error  accumulation  inherent  in  the  standard 
DV-Hop and other metaheuristic-aided variants. The results confirm that 
EPLO-DV-Hop  is  less  sensitive  to  node  density  fluctuations  and  terrain 
complexity, providing reliable localization precision.

The  influence  of  anchor  node  quantity  on  localization  precision  is 
systematically presented in Table 11 A critical observation is that while all 
algorithms  generally  benefit  from  an  increased  number  of  anchors,  the 
degree of improvement varies significantly. The EPLO-DV-Hop algorithm 
exhibits remarkable efficiency and consistency, securing the top rank in 9 
of the 12 cases. Its performance is particularly outstanding in scenarios with 
a moderate number of anchors (20 and 25), where it achieves minimal ALE 
values of 1.4278 and 1.5488 in unimodal terrain, respectively. This suggests 
that  EPLO-DV-Hop  can  extract  maximal  positional  information  from  a 
limited set of reference points, a crucial advantage in cost-sensitive WSN 
deployments  where  anchor  nodes  are  expensive.  Even  in  multimodal 
environments  with  scarce  anchors  (5  nodes),  EPLO-DV-Hop  delivers 
competitive  results  (ALE=2.4844),  demonstrating  its  resilience.  The 
algorithm's ability to maintain low error rates despite constraints on anchor 
node  count  stems  from  its  effective  optimization  core,  which  precisely 
minimizes the discrepancy between estimated and actual distances, thereby 
reducing the dependency on  a  high  density of  anchor nodes  for  accurate 
localization.

Table 12 elucidates the effect of varying the communication radius on the 
localization  performance.  The  results  unequivocally  indicate  that  EPLO-
DV-Hop  achieves  the  highest  accuracy  across  all  tested  communication 
ranges  and  both  terrain  types.  A  prominent  trend  is  the  performance 
convergence  of  all  algorithms  as  the  communication  radius  increases  to 
45m and 50m, due to improved network connectivity reducing the inherent 
limitations  of 
the  DV-Hop  principle.  However,  EPLO-DV-Hop 
distinguishes  itself  by  achieving  superior  accuracy  even  at  smaller  radii 
(25m-35m),  where  network  connectivity  is  challenging.  For  instance,  in 
unimodal  terrain  with  a  30m  radius,  EPLO-DV-Hop  attains  an  ALE  of 
1.3244, which is 35% and 60% lower than WOA-DV-Hop and DV-Hop, 
respectively. Its most impressive result is observed in multimodal terrain at 
a  50m  radius,  achieving  an  exceptional  ALE  of  0.9431,  effectively 
demonstrating  near-optimal  localization  capability.  This  exceptional 
performance,  especially  under  constrained  communication  conditions, 
highlights the strength of EPLO's hybrid exploration-exploitation strategy 
in  mitigating  ranging  inaccuracies  and  solving  the  complex  nonlinear 
equations involved in node location estimation, making it highly suitable 
for real-world applications with variable communication constraints. 
7. Conclusion and future work 
This  study  successfully  developed  and  validated  the  Parallel  Polarized 
Learning  Optimizer  (EPLO),  a  significant  enhancement over the original 
Aurora  Optimization  Algorithm  (PLO).  By  integrating  a  multi-group 
collaborative  architecture,  opposition-based  learning,  adaptive  parameter 
control,  and  advanced  exploitation  mechanisms,  EPLO  effectively 
overcomes  the  core  limitations  of  PLO,  namely  premature  convergence, 

population diversity loss, and inadequate balance between exploration and 
exploitation. Extensive experimental results on standardized IEEE CEC test 
suites  conclusively  demonstrate  that  EPLO  achieves  faster  convergence 
rates, superior solution quality, and enhanced robustness across a diverse 
set of benchmark functions, including unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and 
composition types. Statistical analysis and ranking confirm its outstanding 
performance  against  a  wide  array  of  contemporary  metaheuristics.  The 
practical value of EPLO is further solidified by its successful application to 
five distinct, constrained engineering design problems. In each case, EPLO 
consistently  found  optimal  or  near-optimal  designs  that  satisfied  all 
constraints,  often  outperforming  other  algorithms  in  terms  of  solution 
quality, consistency (low standard deviation), and convergence speed. The 
extension of EPLO to complex domains like 3D UAV path planning amidst 
dynamic  obstacles  and  3D  WSN  localization  further  underscores  its 
versatility and effectiveness in handling real-world, high-dimensional, and 
constrained  optimization  challenges.  The  algorithm's  design,  which 
incorporates  strategies  for  both  global  search  intensification  and  local 
refinement,  proves  highly  effective  for  navigating  complex  search 
landscapes.  Therefore,  EPLO  emerges  as  a  robust,  efficient,  and  reliable 
optimization  tool,  offering  substantial  promise  for  solving  complex 
problems  in  engineering,  robotics,  communications,  and  other  scientific 
fields. 
7.1 Future Work 
Subsequent studies could focus on developing hybrid models that integrate 
EPLO with other optimization techniques or machine learning approaches, 
such as surrogate-assisted evolution or neural network-based predictors, to 
enhance  its  performance  on  problems  with  computationally  expensive 
fitness evaluations.   Further investigation is also warranted into adapting 
EPLO  for  dynamic  optimization  environments  where  the  problem 
landscape  or  constraints  change  over  time,  as  well  as  for  robust 
optimization  under  uncertainty,  which  would  greatly  expand 
its 
applicability  in  real-time  control  and  adaptive  systems.      Addressing  the 
challenges  of  large-scale  optimization  involving  thousands  of  variables 
through strategies like dimension reduction or cooperative co-evolutionary 
frameworks  represents  another  critical  direction.      Extending  the  EPLO 
framework 
to  natively  handle  multi-objective  and  many-objective 
optimization problems  would also be  highly valuable, enabling  its direct 
application to complex design problems requiring the balancing of multiple 
competing  criteria.      Additionally,  a  more  in-depth  exploration  of  the 
parallelization potential inherent in the multi-group EPLO architecture on 
modern  high-performance  computing  platforms,  such  as  GPUs  or 
distributed  clusters,  could  significantly  reduce  computation  times  for 
complex problems.   Finally, conducting a rigorous theoretical analysis of 
EPLO's  convergence  properties  and  stability  would  provide  a  deeper 
understanding  of  its  search  behavior  and  strengthen  its  theoretical 
foundation, while applications to a broader range of domains, such as deep 
learning  architecture  design,  hyperparameter  tuning,  pharmaceutical 
discovery, and financial modeling, could further demonstrate its versatility 
and uncover new challenges for algorithmic refinement.   Pursuing these 
directions  would  substantially  expand  the  capabilities  and  impact  of  the 
EPLO algorithm.
